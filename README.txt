Hello!

AF-1991 is a simple 5-voice polysynth put together using
Tone.js and visualization through Nexus UI.

The interface doesn't exist, but to get it to work
You simply treat your keyboard like a keybed with the
"C" note resting on the "A" key. It then moves across
the keyboard in a way that mimics your standard keybed.

You can toggle the octaves by hitting the "-" and "=" respectively.

Thanks for taking a look :]
